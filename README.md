Wizzeye
========

Wizzeye is a very basic open-source remote assistance solution for
[Iristick Smart Safety Glasses](https://iristick.com).  It allows a glass-wearer
to stream the video from the glasses' cameras to the browser of a remote
observer.  Bidirectional audio communication is also enabled.

Under the hood, Wizzeye makes use of the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
technology to enable direct peer-to-peer communication between the
glass-wearer's phone and the remove observer's computer.
